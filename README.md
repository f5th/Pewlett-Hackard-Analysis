Though a high number of employees are elegible for retirement, the company still has enought employees to fit roles where it might be missing an employee.  the mentorship program will allow to these roles be filled, however, it doesn't meean it the number of newly trained emplyees will be equal to the number of retirees, as a matter of fact, it will be more people retiring than people getting trained.
